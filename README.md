**Project Title:**
SQL-Driven Insights into Digital Behavior and Workplace Wellbeing

**Project Objective:**
To leverage SQL queries on employee behavior data to uncover relationships between social media use, focus apps, screen time, job roles and digital wellbeing with key workplace outcomes such as productivity, stress, burnout and job satisfaction.

**Project Approach:**

Data Exploration and Preparation (SQL Tasks):

Inspect table schemas,

Check for NULLs and data ranges for normalization.

**Core Analytical Queries:**

Social Media Hours vs. Productivity:

Platform Preference Impact:

Focus App Usage and Productivity:

Screen Time Before Sleep vs. Stress:

Break Frequency vs. Burnout:

Work Hours vs. Productivity and Stress:

Job Type and Digital Wellbeing Tool Adoption:

Age Group and Job Satisfaction:

**Join and Advanced Analysis:**

Use JOIN statements to combine demographics, behavior logs, and job info.

Use HAVING and WHERE clauses to filter and compare segments.

**Optional: CTEs and Window Functions for Trend Insights:**

Analyze week-to-week or day-to-day productivity/stress changes.

Create ranks or partitions by employee, age group, or job type.

**Outcome:**

SQL-based dashboards or summaries showing how digital habits affect productivity and wellbeing.

Identification of high-risk behaviors (e.g., long screen time before bed) and beneficial practices (e.g., frequent breaks).

Data-driven recommendations for HR and digital wellness programs.

SQL scripts ready for integration into BI tools (like Tableau or Power BI) for interactive analysis.
